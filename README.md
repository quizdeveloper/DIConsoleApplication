Config dependency injection in .Net Core console application
In this article, I will guide config dependency injection in .Net Core console application. As you know DI is the best way to resolve dependency and initial services. So you can set it up for any project type in .Net Core. About how it works and set up, it's the same with DI in Asp.net Core web application project if you have ever done with Asp.Net Core web app you can very easily set up DI for .Net Core console application.
